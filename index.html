            <p class="sectionSubTag text-samll">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. Its precise definition is disputed and there are disagreements about what the aims of education
                are and to what extent education is different from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These
                disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term "education" can
                also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people and the academic field studying
                educational phenomena.
                There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like
                public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling
                system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal
                education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary education, secondary
                education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like
                teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be distinguished by
                subject, like science education, language education, and physical education.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-samll"> There is disagreement in the academic literature on whether education
                is an evaluative concept. Thick definitions of education affirm this. They state that it is part of the
                nature of education that it is beneficial to the student or leads to some kind of improvement. Different
                thick definitions disagree about what kind of improvement is involved. They contrast with thin
                definitions, which provide a value-neutral explanation of education.[14] A closely related distinction
                is between descriptive and prescriptive conceptions of education. Descriptive conceptions discuss how
                the term is actually used by regular speakers. Prescriptive conceptions express what good education is
                or how education should be practiced.[15] Many thick and prescriptive conceptions hold that education is
                an activity that tries to achieve certain aims.[16] Some concentrate on epistemic aims, like knowledge
                and understanding. Others give more emphasis to the development of skills, like rationality and critical
                thinking, and character traits, like kindness and honesty.[17]
